VECTORIZATION:
It refers to the process of converting operations that would typically be performed on individual elements of arrays or other data structures 
into operations that are performed on entire arrays at once.

BENEFITS:
- Speed: Vectorized operations are typically much faster than their non-vectorized counterparts.

- Readability: Vectorized code is often more readable and concise.

- Less Prone to Errors: By avoiding explicit loops, there is less room for errors related to indexing and other common loop-related issues.

It can be achieved using Pandas and Numpy.
