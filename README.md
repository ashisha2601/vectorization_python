VECTORIZATION:

- It refers to the process of converting operations that would typically be performed on individual elements of arrays or other data structures into operations that are performed on entire arrays at once.

BENEFITS:

- Speed: Vectorized operations are typically much faster than their non-vectorized counterparts.

- Readability: Vectorized code is often more readable and concise.

- Less Prone to Errors: By avoiding explicit loops, there is less room for errors related to indexing and other common loop-related issues.

It can be achieved using Pandas and Numpy. This results in significantly faster execution.

COMPARISION:

- LOOP BASED VERSION: The loop-based version iterates over each element, performing multiplication one element at a time. This introduces overhead due to the repeated loop operations and function calls (append).

- VECTORIZED VERSION: The vectorized version performs the multiplication on the entire array at once, leveraging NumPy's highly optimized internal routines.
